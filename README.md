I hold a PhD in human-robot interactions (HRI), specializing in neuro-symbolic cognitive architectures. I completed my PhD at LAAS-CNRS, the largest public robotics laboratory in France located in Toulouse (the City of Airbus), where I studied cognitive sciences and their application in humanoid robots. I am passionate about AI, robotics, biology (gene editing), cryptography, and malware development.

I speak French, Spanish, and English fluently (in that order) and enjoy meeting and working with people from diverse cultures.

My skills include computer vision, ontology and knowledge graph systems, as well as the design of complex architectures that integrate symbolic AI with deep learning. I have worked on combining physics engines with robotic perception to enhance robot's physical understanding and on visual perspective-taking to create systems capable of leveraging Theory of Mind.

Recently, I have been involved in the creation of HybridAGI, an LLM-based agentic system designed to leverage symbolic AI, deep learning, and evolutionary AI through neuro-symbolic programming. I enjoy working on systems that bridge different paradigms, as this requires a deep understanding and the flexibility to connect similar concepts across different domains.

I know: Python, C, C++, Golang, Nimlang, Solidity, Javascript.

I'm used to work with ROS, Vector and Graph DBs, OpenCV and some deep learning frameworks like Keras, PyTorch etc.

I'm currently learning how to build production-grade Web Apps using React.
