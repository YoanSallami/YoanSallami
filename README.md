🎓 I hold a PhD in human-robot interactions (HRI), specializing in neuro-symbolic cognitive architectures. I completed my PhD at LAAS-CNRS, the largest public robotics laboratory in France located in Toulouse (the City of Airbus ✈️), where I studied cognitive sciences and their application in humanoid robots 🤖. I am passionate about AI 🧠, robotics, biology (gene editing 🧬), cryptography 🔒, and malware development 🐛.

🗣️ I speak French, Spanish, and English fluently (in that order) and enjoy meeting and working with people from diverse cultures 🌍.

My skills include computer vision 📷, ontology and knowledge graph systems 🌐, as well as the design of complex architectures that integrate symbolic AI with deep learning 🧠🤖. I have worked on combining physics engines with robotic perception to enhance robot's physical understanding and on visual perspective-taking to create systems capable of leveraging Theory of Mind 🧠.

Recently, I have been involved in the creation of HybridAGI, an LLM-based agentic system designed to leverage symbolic AI, deep learning, and evolutionary AI through neuro-symbolic programming 🧬🤖. I enjoy working on systems that bridge different paradigms, as this requires a deep understanding and the flexibility to connect similar concepts across different domains.

💻 I know: Python, C, C++, Golang, Nimlang, Solidity, Javascript.

🛠️ I'm used to work with ROS, Vector and Graph DBs, OpenCV and some deep learning frameworks like Keras, PyTorch etc.

🌐 I'm currently learning how to build production-grade Web Apps using React.
